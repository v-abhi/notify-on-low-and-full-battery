# for android
# sometimes there may be some problem in showing remainder in android. try to make image-opener app; ringtone-player app; video-player app default
	
# this occur when there are more than one app for playing same file. ex. video can be played by more vlc; mx-player etc.
# in this cases make anyone default.
















# for making some changes in code
# to change your lowest remainder battery level to another value . Then Replace 30 with any other value. in file "battery.sh"



















# other remainder options
# download any ringtone in folder "battery_alarm"

# FOR REMAINDER AT LOW BATTERY to change image-pop_remainder to ringtone_remainder replace 'battery_low.jpg' in file "battery.sh" with         "name of ringtone in folder" .

# FOR REMAINDER AT FULL BATTERY to change image-pop_remainder to ringtone_remainder replace 'battery_FULL.png' in file "battery.sh" with       "name of ringtone in folder" .

# same can be done for VIDEO_remainder.





















# make this script always working

# open "startup application launcher" in ubuntu
# click on add
